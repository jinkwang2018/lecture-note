/**
 * The <code>Selector</code> interface represents an object which is
 * used to process collection events. The sequence of events that
 * typically take place is for the collection to start, if not all
 * of the bytes can be consumed it selects, and finally when all of
 * the bytes within the entity have been consumed it is ready.
 * <p>
 * The start event is used to immediately consume bytes form the
 * underlying transport, it does not require a select to determine
 * if the socket is read ready which provides an initial performance
 * enhancement. Also when a response has been delivered the next
 * request from the pipeline is consumed immediately.
 * <p>
 * The select event is used to register the connected socket with a
 * Java NIO selector which can efficiently determine when there are
 * bytes ready to read from the socket. Finally, the ready event
 * is used when a full HTTP entity has been collected from the 
 * underlying transport. On such an event the request and response
 * can be handled by a container.
