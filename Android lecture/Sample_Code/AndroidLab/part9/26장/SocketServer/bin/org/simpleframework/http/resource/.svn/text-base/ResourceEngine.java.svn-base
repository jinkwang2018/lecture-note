/**
 * The <code>ResourceEngine</code> is used to create implementations
 * of the <code>Resource</code> interface that suit the targeted
 * resource. Different <code>Resource</code> objects may be needed to 
 * handle different files/directories or even applications. The request
 * URI specified must be a HTTP request URI as of RFC 2616. 
 * <p>
 * The meaning of HTTP URI in this instance is the request URI
 * from a HTTP/x.x request, as RFC 2616 and RFC 2396 defines it
 *
 * <pre> 
 * Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
 *
 * Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
 * absoluteURI = "http:" "//" host [":" port] [abs_path ["?" query]] 
 * abs_path = "/" path_segments         
 * path_segments = segment *( "/" segment )
 * </pre> 
 *
 * The <code>ResourceEngine</code> object must be prepared to accept 
 * the request URI that come in the form outlined above. These can
 * include formats like 
 *
 * <pre> 
 * http://some.host/pub;param=value/bin/index.html?name=value
 * http://some.host:8080/index.en_US.html
 * some.host:8080/index.html
 * /usr/bin;param=value/README.txt
 * /usr/bin/compress.tar.gz
 * </pre>
 *
 * The <code>ResourceEngine</code> implementation should be able to 
 * directly take a Request-URI as defined in RFC 2616 and translate 
 * this into a <code>Resource</code>. This keeps the objects semantics 
 * simple and explicit, although at the expense of performance.
