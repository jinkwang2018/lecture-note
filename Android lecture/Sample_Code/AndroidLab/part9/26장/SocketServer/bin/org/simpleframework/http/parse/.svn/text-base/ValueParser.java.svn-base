/**
 * The <code>ValueParser</code> is used to extract a comma separated 
 * list of HTTP header values. This will extract values without 
 * any leading or trailing spaces, which enables the values to be
 * used. Listing the values that appear in the header also requires
 * that the values are ordered. This orders the values using the 
 * values that appear with any quality parameter associated with it.
 * The quality value is a special parameter that often found in a
 * comma separated value list to specify the client preference.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    image/gif, image/jpeg, text/html
 *    image/gif;q=1.0, image/jpeg;q=0.8, image/png;  q=1.0,*;q=0.1
 *    gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0
 *
 * </pre>
 * The above lists taken from RFC 2616 provides an example of the
 * common form comma separated values take. The first illustrates
 * a simple comma delimited list, here the ordering of values is
 * determined from left to right. The second and third list have
 * quality values associated with them, these are used to specify
 * a preference and thus order. 
 * <p> 
 * Each value within a list has an implicit quality value of 1.0.
 * If the value is explicitly set with a the "q" parameter, then
 * the values can range from 1.0 to 0.001. This parser ensures
 * that the order of values returned from the <code>list</code>
 * method adheres to the optional quality parameters and ensures
 * that the quality parameters a removed from the resulting text.
